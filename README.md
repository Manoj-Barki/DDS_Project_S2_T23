## Abstract

   > Motivation: Now a days, lock systems are being digitalized. Most of them are
 software based which require microprocessors to implement the compilers and
 power supply can also act as a problem in the upcoming future. Microprocessors
 are made up of Silicon, Quartz and other chemicals which are getting depleted
 day by day. Thatâ€™s why we have thought of an idea to make the locks completely
 out of hardware components like integrated circuits and logic gates.
> 
   > Problem Statement:  The project mainly focuses on the betterment of the envi
ronment which is being depleted day by day and might not be there for our future
 generations to use. Since many precious substances like Silicon, Quartz are being
 depleted by the uprising technological era as everything around us is digitalizing.
 So, we are thinking of a design which might reduce the depletion of precious sub
stances as stated above. The usage of mostly hardware components and reducing
 the usage of complex programs that requires microprocessors and compilers to
 run.
  
   > Features:
   We are thinking of using 4 sets of 10 keys that represent every single
 digit decimal number and input them to 4 decimal to BCD converters which will
 be implemented using an encoder. the resulting set of inputs is then compared
 to a 16 bit number which is basically a BCD number that represents the correct
 password to crack the lock. A comparator is used in this deed and the lock opens
 when the given input is equal to the correct password.
